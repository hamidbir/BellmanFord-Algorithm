# BellmanFord-Algorithm
hi dear 
Solves single shortest path problem in which edge weight may be negative but no negative cycle exists.

This algorithm works correctly when some of the edges of the directed graph G may have negative weight. When there are no cycles of negative weight, then we can find out the shortest path between source and destination.

It is slower than Dijkstra's Algorithm but more versatile, as it capable of handling some of the negative weight edges.
